Saving the Universe Again:

	Dif: Very Easy / Easy

Trouble Sort:

	Dif: Medium

	While the idea to solve test 2 is quite easy I had a hard time figuring it.

Go, Gopher!

	Dif: Easy

Cubic UFO:

	Dif: Medium 
	
	Was a mathematic problem, the programming part has 0 difficult. 
	Calculated on paper the area of the cube when rotating it 45 degrees parallel to the given plane and then theta degrees around de OX axis.
	At the end you just need to calculate the z-coordinate of 2 vertex and apply a dicotomic algorithm to find the value of theta. Then just
	rotate 3 center-of-faces points.
